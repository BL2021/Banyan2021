                In the United State, we face a serious problem with recidivism
                rates upwards of 70% (National Institute of Justice). Persevere,
                a national non-profit and Banyan Labs partner, is solving this
                problem as an education and training program to help with
                reintegration skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Banyan Labs was created out of the need to place Persevere
                graduates into jobs through an on-the-job training program.
                Persevere teaches justice-involved individuals how to code and
                certifies them with six industry-recognized certifications,
                including Full Stack Developer. Banyan Labs hires these
                technology graduates, offering them mentoring from experienced
                technology partners, and teaching them how to excel on
                cross-functional development teams.
              </p>

                Working with Banyan Labs provides your business with innovative
                tech solutions and opportunities to make lasting, positive
                social change. Our work is proven, professional, and affordable.
                We’d love to talk with you about your next project.
